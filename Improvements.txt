## Quick Wins (Start Here)

If you want to prioritize, I'd suggest implementing these first:

1. **Stop generation button** - Critical for long generations
2. **Export chat history** - Users will want to save their work
3. **Temperature controls** - Essential for power users
4. **Copy response button** - Common UX need
5. **Dark mode** - Popular request
6. **Markdown rendering** - Makes responses much more readable
7. **System prompts** - Unlocks many use cases

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a software developer, the interaction options with a large language model (LLM) should be geared toward maximizing productivity in coding, debugging, and learning.

Here are the top three recommended interaction options based on typical software development workflows and the capabilities of your Ollama web application:

***

## 1. Code Generation and Boilerplate (Generate Text Mode)

The **Generate Text** mode, corresponding to the Ollama `/api/generate` endpoint, is ideal for single-turn, focused requests where you need the model to output code or text based on an immediate prompt.

* **Primary Use:** Writing short, self-contained functions, generating unit tests, or creating boilerplate code structures.
* **Best Practices:**
    * **Be Specific:** Instead of "Write a file handler," try, "Write a **Go function** `loadConfig(path string)` that reads a JSON file from `path`, unmarshals it into a `Config` struct, and handles I/O and JSON parsing errors gracefully."
    * **Specify Language:** Always explicitly name the programming language (e.g., "Write a Python script...", "Generate a React component...").
    * **Use Code-Specific Models:** When available via your **Model Management** section, use specialized models like **Code Llama**, **Phi**, or **Deepseek Coder** for superior results.

***

## 2. Debugging and Code Review (Chat Mode)

The **Chat Mode** is the most powerful tool for a developer, as it utilizes the Ollama `/api/chat` endpoint to maintain a **conversational history**. This allows the model to remember previous code, errors, and instructions, making it excellent for multi-turn tasks.

* **Primary Use:** Iterative debugging, code explanation, complex refactoring, and pair-programming sessions.
* **Best Practices:**
    * **The System Prompt is Key:** Before your first message, use the **System Prompt** field to define the model's persona and role.
        * *Example:* "You are an expert **Go programmer** and a meticulous code reviewer. Your goal is to identify common Go idioms, memory leaks, and concurrency issues in the code I provide."
    * **Iterate on Errors:** Paste a code snippet, then follow up with the traceback or error message from the compiler/runtime. The model uses the history to suggest fixes for the original code.
    * **Ask for Explanations:** If the code is complex, you can paste it and ask, "Explain the logic of this function step-by-step," or "What are the time and space complexity of this algorithm?"

***

## 3. Model Management and Tuning (Model Management Mode)

The **Model Management** section is crucial for tailoring your LLM experience to developer needs. Different models excel at different things, and the ability to easily **Pull** new ones is vital.

* **Primary Use:** Downloading models optimized for coding tasks, and efficiently freeing up disk space by **Deleting** unused models.
* **Key Options for Developers:**
    * **Temperature (Advanced Settings):**
        * **For Creative Tasks (e.g., suggesting architecture ideas):** Set **Temperature high (0.7 - 1.0)** for more diverse and creative output.
        * **For Factual Tasks (e.g., generating precise code):** Set **Temperature low (0.1 - 0.4)** to reduce hallucination and ensure the output is deterministic and accurate.
    * **Model Rotation:** Keep a rotation of models: a small, fast model (like **Mistral** or **Phi**) for quick docs lookups and a large, capable model (like a 70B **Llama** variant) for challenging or highly nuanced code generation tasks.
